  description: |
    This function solves optimal choices in Constant Elasticity of Substitution problems with constant returns and two inputs in each sub-nest.
    Takes as inputs share and elasticity parameters across layers of sub-nests, as well as input unit costs at the bottom-most layer.
    Works for CES problems with up to four nest layers, and allows for uneven branches, so that some branches go up to four layers, but others have less layers.
    Works with BFW (2022) nested labor input problem.
